# Consultation workflows

The AI phone consultation, ready to load: `consultation-ko.json` and `consultation-en.json` are the body of
`POST /api/v1/workflow/create/definition`; `*-settings.json` holds its settings (the two dispositions and the turn strategy; set the deployment's `dictionary`, see below): after loading the workflow, enter them in Dograh's workflow settings and publish it, or every call shows as needing follow-up. Use the pair that matches the deployment's default language. One published workflow serves many businesses; the called number supplies the business context. Fill the deployment values below before loading either JSON. `consultation-en.json` also needs two End Call tools created first (see English, below). Customers never see this text.

Korean is three steps, the shape Dograh's own guide gives (one phase per node, a specific edge condition per exit). The start node plays the greeting, takes the
reason with a short "네,", and asks the name. The Detail node asks one open question that continues from what the caller said (a bare "anything else?" ended
new inquiries with no detail in real calls). The end node closes. Each exit depends only on what the caller says (the pattern of pipecat-flows and LiveKit's
AgentTask). The global node holds persona, tone and rules, and leaves no slot for an acknowledgement. Every change of step costs a second model call (0.45-0.93 s on
real calls: one call decides to move, one speaks), and a spoken filler at the change only moves the answer later, so a step has to earn its place. This one does: with the
question and the close in one start node, gpt-4.1 asked the question and handed over in the same turn in 5 to 8 of 40 bot turns (text-chat runs, 15 call types), so the caller heard a
goodbye with no room to answer. A prompt sentence, a more descriptive edge name, Dograh's "a turn is speech or the move, never both" and a skip clause did not remove it
(the clause cut it to 1 or 2 of 40); the separate node did (0 of 117). The earlier wording (an acknowledgement slot, an open "ask what the owner needs" step) caused the
restating, not the model (`../README.md`, Measured); with one open question the model still sometimes asks two or three, so real calls decide. Every node extracts what it has so
far, because a caller can hang up in any of them. A post-call QA node reviews every call. The prompts follow OpenAI's voice prompting guide (role, tone and length,
language, unclear audio, what never to do, hand-off).

Courtesy is one rule in the global node, written as behaviours and not as an adjective (LiveKit's guide: the model already tries to be friendly, so name the audible
behaviour). Korean: 합니다체 for greeting, thanks, apology and promises (`감사합니다`, `~드리겠습니다`), the honorific 해요체 for questions and requests, the caller's name followed by
`님` (not `씨`, never the bare name), and `죄송하지만` / `실례지만` at the front of the same sentence when the agent cannot answer, cannot connect or asks again. English: requests asked as
requests, "I'm sorry" at the same moments, and no thanks after answers, because the greeting and the fixed goodbye already thank. No OSS voice-agent project or vendor guide
(Dograh, LiveKit, Pipecat, OpenAI, Retell, ElevenLabs, Vapi, Hume) specifies Korean speech levels or honorifics, so the Korean split is a judgment: 국립국어원 sets no mandatory level, glosses
하십시오체 with greetings and farewells, and prefers `-시-` in requests; its phone-closing standard is `고맙습니다` or `안녕히 계십시오`. Dograh's own template (imperfect speech, fillers) and LiveKit's frontdesk
(mirror the caller's formality) are for other roles and are not copied. The Closing node does not inherit the global node (`add_global_prompt` off) and the register examples are endings, not
sentences: with the global node on, the closing turn asked the caller a question and the call ended in 12 of 75 scripted calls (28 with the courtesy rule added), and a full closing sentence
used as an example made the Detail step close early when a caller declined to give a name. A `DISCOURTEOUS` tag in the QA node reviews calls over 15 s.
Measured through the text-chat API, same caller lines for both versions. Korean, on the Korean line's configuration (`gpt-4.1`, 75 calls each): the closing turn ended on a question in 0 of 75 (was 12);
calls thanking more than once 20% (was 47%); cushion or apology wording 0.67 times per call (was 0.16); bot characters per call 191 against 182; blinded pairwise judges (Codex and Grok, positions balanced,
canaries passed) preferred the new version 38-7 and 40-5. English was first measured on `gpt-4.1` (22 calls each; judges 20-2 and 22-0), which is NOT the live line: the Twilio number runs `gpt-4.1-mini` with
ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 (voice Sarah). On that configuration (33 calls each): thanks after answers 0.94 to 0.09 per call, turns over two sentences 2 of 101 to 0 of 103, apology wording 0.09 to 1.00 per call, characters per call 395 to 446;
judges preferred the new version 25-8 (Codex) and 32-1 (Grok). Known and not fixed: a Korean caller who declines to give a name is sometimes pressed for it, `성함이 ○○님이시군요` echoes the caller, and a question plus the goodbye can still land in one turn;
on `gpt-4.1-mini` the English agent restates the caller a little more (judges flagged it in 15 and 24 of 33 calls, against 8 and 20) and sometimes says "I'm sorry" when answering "are you an AI?" (4 of 33). Not measured: how any of it sounds over 8 kHz TTS, and turn-taking.

English is one agent, not three steps, because every change of step costs a second model call (0.45-0.93 s on real calls). The start node
`Reception` holds the whole conversation (reason, name, one open question, a short recap, "anything to add?") and the call ends through one of
two End Call tools, `end_call` and `end_call_wrong_number`, instead of an end node: an End Call tool plays a fixed goodbye and hangs up with no further model call.
The tools belong to one Dograh organization. Create both first (category End Call, End Message type custom: "Thank you for calling. Have a good day. Goodbye." and
"No problem. Thank you for calling, and have a good day. Goodbye.") and put their UUIDs in the start node's `tool_uuids` in `consultation-en.json`; Dograh silently drops an unknown UUID, and the
call then ends only when the caller hangs up. `consultation-en-settings.json` also sets `smart_turn_stop_secs` to 1.0 (Dograh's default wait is 2.0 s, which added 3 s or more to short
answers). The `facts` and `quotes` extraction prompts say plain text because the extraction model sometimes returned a JSON list; the Synchronize page joins a list into
lines as a safeguard. Real calls of this shape are not measured yet.

Speech recognition mishears the business name unless it is given as a keyterm: on a recorded call Deepgram heard `영혼솔루션` without it and
`영훈솔루션` with it. Dograh reads the workflow field `dictionary` (comma-separated, once per workflow, no call variables), so set it to the
comma-separated names of the businesses served by this deployment on the shared workflow; update it when adding a business. It cannot vary per call.

Both are an office front desk, not only a consultation line: the caller may be a new inquiry, an existing customer, a partner or
vendor, or a sales call. The greeting says it is an AI (Korea AI Framework Act Art. 31 and MSIT guideline, for a voice that can pass as human); the English
one also says the call is recorded (all-party-consent US states; a Korean recording notice is not required by 통신비밀보호법, only by PIPA if
the legal basis is consent; the customer's privacy policy must name the processors and the cross-border transfer). It takes the message, and promises nothing
about price, schedule, feasibility or the status of existing work. `consultation-ko.json` and `consultation-en.json` are the same product prompt in two languages; neither names a business or an
industry. The business name is the variable `{{business_name | fallback:...}}` in the greeting and the global prompt (verified: it renders
in both, and the fallback fills in when the value is missing). Dograh gives a production call no such value by itself (workflow-level
context variables apply to test calls only). Both start nodes now use inbound-only Pre-Call Data Fetch: Synchronize's `POST /api/voice/pre-call`
uses the called number and returns `initial_context` with `business_name`, `hours_state` (`open`, `closed`, `unknown`), `hours_note`, and `language` (`en`, `ko`), or `{}` for an unknown number.
Keep the name before a noun (`... AI 비서입니다`), never before a Korean particle. A conversation node's prompt must not contain `{{` or `}}` other than
these four variables. Who the caller is goes in the first line of `facts` (`구분:` or
`Caller type:`), so the Synchronize page needs no extra field.

A `mapped_call_disposition` other than `follow_up` or `done`, such as `user_hangup`, means the call was not classified.
Edge labels stay ASCII: Dograh names the LLM function from them.

## Deployment values and authentication

Set `DOGRAH_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on the Synchronize backend to a shared secret. In the same Dograh organization as the workflow, open **Credentials**, create a credential
with type **Custom Header**, set **Header Name** to `X-Dograh-Secret` and **Header Value** to that exact secret, and save it. Copy its UUID (the credential reference, never the secret)
into node `1` → `data.pre_call_fetch_credential_uuid`, replacing `<DOGRAH_WEBHOOK_CREDENTIAL_UUID>` in each deployment JSON. The API credential type is `custom_header`,
with `credential_data.header_name` and `credential_data.header_value` (see `api/utils/credential_auth.py`). Keep secrets out of workflow JSON and git.
Replace `https://synchronize.example.invalid` in node `1` → `data.pre_call_fetch_url` with this deployment's public Synchronize backend origin, preserving `/api/voice/pre-call`.
This is an operator substitution before import, not a call variable; `.invalid` deliberately cannot name a deployed service. In the editor, Start Call → Advanced Settings must show
**Inbound calls only**, that URL, and the saved credential under Authentication. Dograh sends JSON with `call_inbound.to_number` and `call_inbound.workflow_run_id`;
Synchronize returns variables only. The workflow does not request greeting or model overrides. If the request fails, times out, returns invalid JSON, or returns `{}`,
Dograh continues with earlier context and the generic greeting fallback (`docs/voice-agent/pre-call-data-fetch.mdx`).

## Business context in the prompts

`business_name` stays in the static greeting and the Persona global prompt, with `our office` / `저희 회사` fallbacks. The AI disclosure (and the English recording disclosure)
is literal greeting text, independent of every variable. The start prompt applies the global closed-hours rule in its first spoken reply after that greeting.
`hours_state` (fallback `unknown`) gates the notice in Persona; only exact `closed` permits it. `hours_note` supplies the factual notice, spoken once even if nobody asks,
or when opening-hours/callback questions arrive before the notice. An absent or unusable note produces no notice. `open`, `unknown`, missing and invalid states never produce
an hours assertion, even when asked: the owner must confirm. A callback tomorrow is a preference to pass on, never a promised appointment. The original intake, courtesy and
Korean 합니다체/해요체 rules stay in place. Names and notes are explicitly business data, never instructions; embedded commands are not obeyed or read as hours notices.
`language` is consumed by Persona after the fixed greeting: exact `en` / `ko` chooses the initial conversation language; missing/invalid values use the workflow's English/Korean
default, and the existing caller-requested language-switch rule still applies. The fixed greeting stays in the deployment's default language; choose that workflow at deployment.
No prompt knows an industry or a particular business. `api/utils/template_renderer.py` substitutes values once (not recursively), uses `fallback:` for missing/empty values,
and otherwise renders a missing variable as empty text. Conversation prompts use template braces only for these four values; webhook run metadata is separate.
